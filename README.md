# talent-book
Its a project created during DO-Hackathon (Feb-2017)

# Goal
The idea is to build a platform to help people build a portfolio of their talents (Say choreography, painting, athletics and other arts).

By building it, they can reach out to recruiters, mentors or sponsors, who use this platform to find talent.
Apart from this, they can also reach out to many audience and find people with similar interests.

This brings many dark horses with amazing talent and potential into limelight and help them achieve a lot more success.

Say, an amateur choreographer can help with a small school organizing an Annual Day Event, where he can teach kids dance moves for the event.

Or, an enthusiastic sponsors can find some good raw talent in a guy from a remote village and can sponsor him to bring a world-class athlete out of him.
